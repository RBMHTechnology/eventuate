/**
 * Provider API.
 *
 * Event storage format. Fields `localLogId` and `localSequenceNr` differ among replicas, all other fields are not changed
 * during event replication.
 *
 * @param payload Application-defined event.
 * @param emitterId Id of emitter ([[EventsourcedActor]]).
 * @param emitterAggregateId Aggregate id of emitter ([[EventsourcedActor]]). This is also the default routing destination
 *                           of this event. If defined, the event is routed to event-sourced actors or views with a matching
 *                           `aggregateId`. In any case, the event is routed to event-sourced actors and views with an
 *                           undefined `aggregateId`.
 * @param customDestinationAggregateIds Aggregate ids of additional, custom routing destinations. If non-empty, the event is
 *                                      additionally routed to event-sourced actors and views with a matching `aggregateId`.
 * @param systemTimestamp Wall-clock timestamp, generated by the source of concurrent activity that is identified by `processId`.
 * @param vectorTimestamp Vector timestamp, generated by the source of concurrent activity that is identified by `processId`.
 * @param processId Id of the causality-tracking source of concurrent activity. By default, this is the id of the event log
 *                  that initially wrote the event. If the emitting [[EventsourcedActor]] has set `sharedClockEntry` to `false`
 *                  then this is the id of that actor (which is the `emitterId`).
 * @param localLogId Id of the local event log.
 * @param localSequenceNr Sequence number in the local event log.
